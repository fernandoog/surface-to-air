With our project we want to make people aware of the problem we have with pollution, so that we have designed a system that unifies the data generated by NASA together with other sources of public, private and collaborative networks on a single platform (Simple Data Pollution Realtime Network).
We have also created a platform for processing this data, as well as different prototypes of IoT sensors for any citizen who can join the project by sharing their data in real time to use it in apps, webs...

aqmap
------------------------------------------------------
Aqmap is the data-visualization tool for the air quality data. It's simply a Leaflet map rendered using P5.js and Mappa, two awesome libraries for the more artistic side of JavaScript.
It's based on:
* Dividing the canvas in a grid of (width/10 * height/10)
* The pixel coordinates corresponding to every block of the grid are projected to longitude and latitude, real-world values
* The script asks a server for predicted air quality value for that specific time, longitude and latitude.
* Data is represented ranging from green (0 minutes of life lost per day there) to red (20 minutes of life lost per day there)
* The values are updated dynamically when either the selected time (through the slider) or space (through the interactive map) change
