With our project we want to make people aware of the problem we have with pollution, so that we have designed a system that unifies the data generated by NASA together with other sources of public, private and collaborative networks on a single platform (Simple Data Pollution Realtime Network).
We have also created a platform for processing this data, as well as different prototypes of IoT sensors for any citizen who can join the project by sharing their data in real time.
